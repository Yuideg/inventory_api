# Inventory APP ER Diagram    
 This **ER** diagram has **six** entities . These are    
 1. **user**
 2. **role**
 3. **product/item**
 4. **stock**

-  ## USER  
 users act as an admin and end user or customer their role is identified when then login to the system. The system indentify what type user is trying to login the system and the system finds it role in the database role table ,and then if the role is admin  the user can acess resources depend on the permision given to users and if the logger user is not an admin or the system  finds user role then the app provides a permision to the  system only to access permissions givento user role .
 - ## ROLE
 role is used to identify what user is trying login to the system and access the resource
 - ## ITEM 
 items  are products which are needed by the customer or ende uers which is owned by the admin user
 In this project I give name to items  **AS Produc  DON't Confuse.**
 
 - ## STOCK
 stocks are organizationa megazine used  as container or storage area for items provided by different supplier plc.
 - ## SUPPLIER 
 suppliers are govermental or private organization which provide different commodities for end user

  ### TO RUN APP 
 - step 1. user must have appropraite golang editor e.g visual studio code ,atom ,goland ...etc
 - step 2. user must have installed golang step up it is recommended to install current version go 1.16 and above
 - step 3. user must correctly position the porjects in the GOPATH root folder and give it GOROOT PATH
 - step 4. user must first check all dependency library is found or check if there were no errors in the project folder 
 - step 5. with this app it uses postgresql dbms for databse , user should install current version of postgresql and create there own database and give some exaternal data type extension like ISSN and UUID and then create tables which is provided in this project folder with name database.sql and insert value to the table by updaing foreign key values which is not static becuase id of the table generated by defualt when we insert other columns of the table. values. Some values are provided in the input.sql file but YOU have to **KNOW** that foriegn key must be updated unless it doesn't work becuase matching foreign key value is not found . Other column values are depends on the user choice of values but user role cann't add ,remove and update the table value it gives insufficient permision warning.
